# what i build
- developer toys and silly trinkets
- backends that stay silent
- ml that predicts the obvious faster than i can

# how i work
- apis that don’t lie; errors that do math
- inputs are guilty until validated
- logs are structured, not emotional
- one day: my own kernel; today: c's in the alphabet?
