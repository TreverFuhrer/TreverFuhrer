# what i build
Architect of cross-dimensional integration frameworks for synchronous digital ecosystems, specializing in the orchestration of self-regulating processes across uncertain boundaries. Engineer of autonomous computational entities designed to misinterpret purpose with elegance. My work focuses on scalable synchronization of emotion, logic, and state. Systems that run not because they must, but because they’ve learned to want to. Former director of spontaneous recursion at the Bureau for Algorithmic Disassociation.
