# what i build
- developer toys that remove boring steps
- backends that stay quiet under load
- small ml that predicts the obvious faster than i can

## how i work
- apis that don’t lie; errors that do math
- inputs are guilty until validated
- logs are structured, not emotional
- one day: my own kernel; today: fewer syscalls per request

**proof of life**  
tests: ✅ · ci: ✅ · releases: semver-ish · issues: human-friendly
